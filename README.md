# parrhesia-frontend

The frontend code for https://parrhesia.chat/

## About

Parrhesia is a very basic end-to-end encrypted chatting service.

## Quantum Computing

Parrhesia is not yet quantum-proof. The current hybrid approach has known faults and is definitely not safe against quantum adversaries or knowledgeable bad actors (albeit some issues are more trivial than others). Parrhesia.chat is a use-at-your-own-risk service. This will, of course, change as time progresses.
